# NFL-trivia-grid

12.28.23

This project is inspired by the popular sports trivia game, Immaculate Grid. In the game, you are presented with a 3 x 3 grid, with each row and column corresponding to an NFL team or statistical category. The user will go through the grid and attempt to name a player that played for both teams or satisfied the statistical category. For example, if the first row is labeled "SF 49ers" and the first column is labeled "KC Chiefs", then you would have to name a player who played for both the Chiefs and the 49ers during their career. You will repeat this process for the rest of the squares, and at the end you will receive a score for the number of players you guessed correctly. I hope you all enjoy the game !
